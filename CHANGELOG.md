## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-19

First beta release. The codebase has been validated against 50 real local
Claude Code projects (23 with sessions) × 4 target agents = 92 migrations
without failure, and carries 88 tests covering every source parser,
target adapter, security guard, and hub integration path.

### Added

- **Workspace Dossier (项目档案)** — the vendor-neutral intermediate the
  whole tool revolves around. Same class that was internally called
  `CanonicalData` / "Canonical IR"; the new name is what users actually
  see. Both names are exported from the top-level package.
- **3-step CLI** — `ccm export` (source → dossier.json), `ccm apply`
  (dossier + target → generated project dir), `ccm migrate` (one-shot).
  `ccm scan` kept as a legacy / power-user verb that dumps the raw
  scanner dict (used by `ccm push-hub`).
- **Scanner coverage → 60+ data types**. Previous releases captured only
  metadata for sessions / plans / todos / history. Now also captures:
  - `projects/<enc>/*.jsonl` full message bodies
  - `projects/<enc>/<uuid>/subagents/` sub-agent transcripts
  - `projects/<enc>/<uuid>/tool-results/` cached tool payloads
  - `plans/*.md`, `todos/*.json`, `history.jsonl` full contents
  - `~/.claude.json` per-project state + top-level meta
  - `shell-snapshots/`, `session-env/`, `file-history/`,
    `mcp-needs-auth-cache.json`
  - `--max-session-mb` flag with cap warning when hit (default 32 MB)
- **Reverse source parsers** — cursor / opencode / hermes / windsurf →
  dossier, enabling any-to-any migration (e.g. Cursor → OpenCode,
  Hermes → Windsurf) without going through Claude.
- **`redactor.py`** module — scrubs plaintext secrets at every disk-write
  boundary. Combines key-name whitelist (ported from neuDrive upstream's
  `looksSensitiveKey`) with free-form regex scanning (sk-ant-*, ghp_*,
  AKIA*, Bearer, PEM private keys, BigModel 32.16). Redacted values
  become `${CC_<PATH>}` env-var placeholders; the adapters pass these
  through to target configs unchanged.
- **10 hub integration tests** via a local HTTP mock that mimics
  neuDrive's `{ok:true,data:{}}` envelope — verifies every NeuDriveHub
  method's verb / path / payload and end-to-end `push_scan_to_hub`
  routing (profile, scratch memory, skills, cowork conversations).
- `py.typed` marker so downstream type checkers pick up the package's
  inline type annotations.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file) and `RELEASE.md` runbook.

### Changed

- **File permissions for dossier / scan artifacts are now 0o600**
  (user-only, was world-readable 0o644). Sibling
  `<stem>.secrets-manifest.json` lists SHA256 prefixes of everything
  scrubbed so users have an audit trail.
- `--token` on `ccm push-hub` is discouraged (still works, prints a
  stderr warning that it's visible in `ps aux`). New `--token-stdin`
  reads the token from stdin; `NEUDRIVE_TOKEN` env var remains the
  preferred path.
- `--in-place` on `ccm apply` / `ccm migrate` runs a `git status --porcelain`
  check before writing. Dirty trees are rejected with an enumerated diff;
  pass `--force` to override.
- Python classifier bumped from `3 - Alpha` to `4 - Beta`. Python 3.13
  and 3.14 added to the supported versions matrix.
- 5 silent `except Exception: pass` blocks in scanner / sources /
  adapters were replaced with narrowed exceptions + stderr warnings
  (previously swallowed parse errors).

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: MCP `Authorization: Bearer <token>` no longer appears
  verbatim in `dossier.json`. Previously the redactor did not exist, so
  the intermediate IR file shipped plaintext secrets the README told
  users to commit.
- **CRITICAL**: Pasted API keys in `history.jsonl` `display` fields and
  session message bodies are redacted. Free-form regex catches secrets
  inside prose, which neuDrive's `key=value` line-oriented redactor
  misses.
- **CRITICAL**: Shell snapshots, session-env bundles, and file-history
  entries are scanned recursively — they commonly contain `export
  FOO_API_KEY=...` lines that prior versions captured but never scrubbed.
- **HIGH**: `parse_cowork_zip` now rejects ZIP entries over 500 MB
  uncompressed or with compression ratio > 1000× (zip-bomb guard,
  `ZipBombError`), and rejects entry names containing `..` or starting
  with `/`.
- **MEDIUM**: `NeuDriveHub.write_file` rejects paths with `..` / `.`
  segments or NUL bytes client-side. Previously only the server
  validated.
- **MEDIUM**: ZIP member matching uses exact basename instead of
  `endswith()`, which previously would have matched crafted entries like
  `evilconversations.json` or `../conversations.json`.
- **MEDIUM**: `push_scan_to_hub` no longer silently drops HTTP errors.
  Per-item failures are accumulated and printed to stderr at the end;
  the return dict carries an `errors` count.
- Hermes adapter KeyError on any account that has Cowork plugins
  installed — `to_adapter_scan()` now re-exposes the legacy
  `plugin_name` field alongside IR-renamed `name`.
- 4 unused imports removed (`Attachment`, `MemoryItem`, `Any`,
  `build_universal_agents_md`, `os` — each in different modules).
- `__version__` drift between `src/__init__.py` (was `0.1.0`) and
  `pyproject.toml` (`0.2.0`) — now synced.

### Removed

- Untracked working-note drafts (`ideas-full.md`,
  `reference/agent-frameworks-comparison.md`) — were one-off scratchpads
  never referenced from tracked files.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04

Initial proof of concept. Single source (Claude Code) → four targets
(Hermes, OpenCode, Cursor, Windsurf). Cowork ZIP parser. Metadata-only
session capture. Legacy `ccm scan` + `ccm migrate` CLI. neuDrive Hub
HTTP client.
